# **Beware of the Monster**
## ***Chapter 1***
### *Once upon a time...* 
In a very cold, dark and sad little village, there was a boy. This boy, unfortunate as the gods intended, carried all the bad luck combined of those who were blessed and liked by the supreme beings. 
Some say fate might be cruel..., well imagine being brought to this world and realize you had to accept all the unfairness's written in god's agenda, often called destiny. 
But that is just how the world works. There's the winners and the losers. For some to have good luck there has to be someone who lacks of it. If everyone had good luck, then probably everyone would have a happy life. And that's just boring, from the god's perspective.
Afterall, it's exactly like a game. If you held the destiny of every single character in the game in your hand, would you make them all the same? Of course not, that would be boring. We like to believe we're not bad persons, but eventually we would fuck up some character just for the fun of it.
That's the upside of being god. Their suffering won't influence a single thing in your life. Because you're above them, and they can't do anything to reach you. Or so they thought...
